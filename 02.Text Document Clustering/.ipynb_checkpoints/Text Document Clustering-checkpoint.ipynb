    "\n",
    "In order to understand the practical application of Text Document Clustering we must first understand the problem we are trying to solve\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem in question would be the existance of large bodies of text, that we would like to segment and categorize according to similaraties in context and subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the fact that most of the data, text included, that has ever been generated by humanity has been generated in the last 30 years, and most of it is \n",
    "unlabled and uncathegorized this is a very much present problem and increasing with the pasage of time \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this article is to show the effectivenes of machine learnig in obtaining a usefull categorization of text so that finding the subject of interest is easier and faster than it would be lacking a clear categorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that purpose we shall be using several data sources:\n",
    "- NPR News Articles https://www.npr.org/\n",
    "- Drug Side Effects https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jithinanievarghese/drugs-side-effects-and-medical-condition\n",
    "- Spotify Million Song Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset\n",
    "- Twitter Financial News https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulphatet/twitter-financial-news\n",
    "\n",
    "As it can be noticed these data source are varied in data and subject matter. We intend to see if we can find a good category for the text data present in these data sources."
